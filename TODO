 ~~Finished - Basic Tick Example~~

 *- copy the seed and create a new game!

 - setup doing sprites with canvas draw image
	*- delete old code for graphics
	*- get a sprite rendering (hypothetically)
	*- get the sprite showing and working
		*- No errors
		*- get sprite showing… troubleshooting

	*- properly write out the basics of graphics reducer

	- add slime character in far away position.

	- add a fireball attack for thief. use walking on the spot as the casting animation, then attack animation to throw the fireball, then seek the fireball.

	- add click movement

 - Organize files
 - ensure HMR is working for everything still





 - Finish the new game
	~~ No Graphics -> Shape Graphics -> Sprites ~~

	- ipad mini resolution
	- make a fightable entity type
		[x, y, hp, stats] (see below for max flexability)
		[mov = () => {…} //selector based on stats]
		[maxhp = () => {…} //selector based on stats]
		[All other abilities are based on stats]

	// bowman.js
	export default {
        	actions: []
		reducer: () => {}
		mov: () => pixels per second
		maxhp: () => …
		defaultStats: { … }
        }
	entityTraits = { bowman, fightable }

	createEntity({ traits: [‘bowman’, ‘awesome’, ‘wizard’] });

	in entity reducer:
	state.traits.reduce((state, trait) => {
		return entityTraits[trait].reducer(state, action);
	}, state);

	const traitDependents = {
		fightable: [‘bowman’, ‘wizard’]
	};
	const traitDependencies = {
		bowman: ‘fightable’
		wizard: ‘fightable’
	};
	// auto resolve reducers based on dependencies or dependents

	- create a bowmen as a fightable entity type
		~~How???~~
		~~in entities, but has different actions???~~
	- create and draw bowmen with upside down triangle
	- add movement with click, seek to location

	- add slime as a fightable entity type
	- Have slime slowly seek towards any good guys

	- add automatic attacking enemy if in range
	- add right click skill pushback attack

	- add automatic attack for slime

	- ???What else to add to test system???



 - see notes, and do turn based RPG with 2d plane

 - pause individual ticks, would be handy. Could freeze a character and all their abilities, or just an ability, etc.

 - Advanced Logger with a tree
	~ maybe in middleware to detect generator, then pass on to effect processor that it has a parent. I would need to intercept “put” effects to add them to the tree, and add a branch to be passed on to other put effects, also tick?? Different colours for effects and actions?
